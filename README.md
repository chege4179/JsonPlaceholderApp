This is a simple app that consumes the [fake REST API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) to display a
list of posts

The object of the app was to demostrate how to use the [sealedX library](https://github.com/skydoves/sealedX)
to generate Ui State classes as part of my talk for the July android254 meetup


The tech stack includes Retrofit for network request, Koin for DI and Jetpack compose for UI
